My personal development playground site which is a NextJS app with Typescript and partially tailwindCSS + custom SCSS for complexer work. Here and there there are some python utils scattered arround and currently the backend (authentication, fetching and posting data) is done through a document db (nosql) Firebase. 

I also have Planetscale (mysql) with Prisma as the ORM setup which I want to migrate to in the feature with either clerk as auth provider or nextAuth.

Currently working on multiple features as I can't decide on which to finish first I rotate whenever I feel like.

-Endless refactoring/new designs for my (initial) portfolio landing page. Some components are done, but far from 1.0
-Personal dashboard which allows me to track expenses and log certain data (e.g. items which I need to purcashe for moving out of the house).
    
Somewhat finished <small>(Allthrough the UI is not perfect) </small> is the HTML to JSX / TSX converter I build which allows for converting HTML to one of those and allows for instant creation of components with, or without props and nextJS client support. Can be used at <a href="https://remcostoeten.com/html-to-jsx" target="_blank">https://remcostoeten.com/html-to-jsx</a>.

And waaaaay more which I will list out eventually, all behind protected routes or semi broken UI
