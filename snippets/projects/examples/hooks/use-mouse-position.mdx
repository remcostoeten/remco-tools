# How to Use the `useMousePosition` Hook in React

The `useMousePosition` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to track the mouse's position on the screen. This can be useful for various scenarios, such as creating interactive components or adding visual effects based on the mouse's movement. In this guide, you will learn how to use the `useMousePosition` hook in your React applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
- A React project set up and ready to use.

## Installation

To use the `useMousePosition` hook, you don't need to install any additional packages. It's a custom hook that you can add to your React project directly. Simply include the hook code in your project:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

/**
 * useMousePosition Hook
 *
 * A custom React Hook that tracks the mouse position on the screen.
 *
 * @returns The current mouse position as an object with `x` and `y` coordinates.
 */
const useMousePosition = () => {
    const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

    useEffect(() => {
        /**
         * Event handler for the 'mousemove' event.
         * Updates the mouse position in the state.
         *
         * @param event The MouseEvent object.
         */
        const handleMouseMove = (event: MouseEvent) => {
            setPosition({
                x: event.clientX,
                y: event.clientY,
            });
        };

        document.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);

        return () => {
            document.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
        };
    }, []);

    return position;
};

export default useMousePosition;
```

## Example Usage Scenarios

Here are some example usage scenarios for the `useMousePosition` hook:

### Scenario 1: Display Mouse Position

```javascript
import useMousePosition from './useMousePosition';

function MyComponent() {
  const { x, y } = useMousePosition();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Mouse position: {x}, {y}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Scenario 2: Follow the Mouse Cursor

```javascript
import useMousePosition from './useMousePosition';

function FollowCursor() {
  const { x, y } = useMousePosition();

  return (
    <div className="relative">
      <div
        className="absolute w-4 h-4 bg-red-500 rounded-full"
        style={{ left: x, top: y }}
      ></div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Scenario 3: Create a Parallax Effect

```javascript
import useMousePosition from './useMousePosition';

function ParallaxEffect() {
  const { x, y } = useMousePosition();

  return (
    <div
      className="w-screen h-screen bg-black"
      style={{ transform: `translate(${x / 10}px, ${y / 10}px)` }}
    >
      <div className="w-[500px] h-[500px] flex flex-col gap-4 justify-normalcenter bg-slate-400">
        <h1>Parallax Effect</h1>
        <p>Move your mouse to see the effect!</p>
        <button>Click Me</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

These examples demonstrate how to use the `useMousePosition` hook in different scenarios to track and utilize the mouse position in your React components.

## Conclusion

The `useMousePosition` hook is a versatile tool for tracking and utilizing the mouse position in your React applications. By integrating it into your components, you can create interactive and visually appealing user experiences.

Now you're ready to enhance your React applications with mouse position tracking!
